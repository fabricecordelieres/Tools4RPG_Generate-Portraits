# Tools4RPG_Generate-Portraits

*When playing contemporary RPG, it might be usefull to get NPC portraits. Google Image might be a good source of pictures, having however the drawback to offer portraits of "real persons". To circunvent this problem, other sources might be used, such as the [This person does not exist website](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) by [Karras et al. and Nvidia](https://research.nvidia.com/person/tero-karras).
However, the website does not currently allow setting parameters and a random portrait will be generated. As a consequence, one might have to refresh multiple times the webpage to finally get the appropriate portrait.
To work around this problem, the present script allows generating several portraits, and download them. The GM might then be able to pickup a portrait, from a large list of generated images.*
